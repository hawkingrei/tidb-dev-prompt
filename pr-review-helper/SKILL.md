# pr-review-helper

Collect baseline information for PR review with minimal back-and-forth. Prefer GitHub MCP for all reads; if MCP lacks data or is unavailable, fall back to `gh` CLI.

## Required Inputs

- Repository owner/name
- PR number

If any are missing, ask the user once. Do not guess.

## Workflow (Prefer GitHub MCP)

1. **PR overview**
   - Use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: get` to capture title, author, base/head branches, and head SHA.

2. **All comments and review suggestions**
   - Review comment threads: `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: get_review_comments`.
     - Extract: file path, line, author, body.
     - If a suggestion block exists, capture the suggested patch and map it to the diff hunk.
   - Review summary: `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: get_reviews`.
     - Capture approvals, change requests, and top-level review bodies.
   - PR/issue comments: `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: get_comments`.
     - Include non-review discussion.

3. **Diff context**
   - Use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: get_diff` for full diff.
   - If the diff is large, also request `method: get_files` to scope by file before drilling into relevant hunks.

4. **CI status**
   - Use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: get_status` for the head SHA.
   - Identify failing checks. If failures appear to be GitHub Actions, proceed to logs.

5. **GitHub Actions logs (when failures exist)**
   - If MCP does not provide sufficient log details, fall back to `gh` CLI.
   - Suggested flow:
     - `gh pr checks <PR>` to list failing runs and run IDs.
     - `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` to extract the failure reason.
     - If logs are truncated or need full context:
       - `gh run download <run-id>` then inspect the downloaded logs.

## Fallback Workflow (gh CLI Only)

Use this when MCP is unavailable or incomplete.

1. **PR overview**
   - `gh pr view <PR> --json title,author,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid`

2. **Comments and review threads**
   - `gh pr view <PR> --json comments,reviews,reviewThreads`
   - Parse `reviewThreads` for file/line and suggestion blocks.

3. **Diff**
   - `gh pr diff <PR>`

4. **CI status and logs**
   - `gh pr checks <PR>`
   - `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
   - `gh run download <run-id>` if full logs are needed

## Output Expectations

Provide a concise summary with:

- Review comments grouped by file/line, including suggestion patches if present
- Non-review discussion comments that may affect changes
- CI status: pass/fail, failing jobs, and key error messages
- Clear action items for the PR author

Do not post new comments, re-run CI, or update the PR unless the user explicitly asks.
